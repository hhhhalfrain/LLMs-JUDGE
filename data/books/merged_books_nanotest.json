She tries to argue with logic and precedent; her mother answers with authority and finality. Violet’s body protests before her mind finishes processing: old pain, weak joints, the familiar cost of simply standing too long. Around her, the war college feels like a machine built to grind down hesitation.\n\nShe packs quickly—practical items, notes, a few comforts—and runs through survival rules she’s heard whispered: trust slowly, watch the parapets, and never assume someone won’t push you.\n\nBy night, she studies maps and rumors. Riders are power and politics. Dragons are not pets. And in Basgiath, the line between training and execution is… not a line at all."

Violet keeps to the edge, conserving energy, measuring exits, noticing who watches whom. Some recruits boast loudly—performance as armor. Others stay silent, their eyes fixed on the narrow walkways that bridge the heights.\n\nA senior cadet reads the rules with a smile that doesn’t reach their eyes: there will be tests, eliminations, and consequences. Violet hears the unspoken part: the college is not obligated to keep you alive.\n\nWhen the first trial is announced, the crowd shifts. Violet’s pulse spikes. She fights the reflex to freeze and instead breaks the problem into parts: footing, pace, breathing, and angles. Survive the first hour. Then the next."

Violet forces her gaze forward, not down. She counts steps in sets of ten. Her muscles tremble, then stabilize into a careful rhythm.\n\nHalfway across, someone behind her stumbles. The sound—boot scraping stone—hits her like a physical shove. Violet’s instinct is to help, but helping is a liability here. She compromises: she shifts just enough to avoid collision, keeps moving, keeps breathing.\n\nOn the far side, cadets land in messy relief. Some laugh too loudly. Some vomit. Violet rests her hands on her knees, waiting for the shaking to stop.\n\nThen she notices the eyes on her—the ones that evaluate weakness the way merchants evaluate flawed goods."

A cadet with a charming smile offers her a seat, then tests her with pointed questions about her mother’s influence.\n\nViolet answers with careful half-truths, keeping her tone neutral. She knows status makes her a target: some will want to use her, others will want to hurt her to prove a point.\n\nTraining begins with pain: sprint drills, combat stances, and instructors who correct mistakes by making them unforgettable. Violet adapts. She uses leverage, timing, and distance. She listens more than she speaks.\n\nAt night, she writes down what matters: who pushes too hard, who watches quietly, and who seems to enjoy cruelty.\n\nShe also writes one private rule: never confuse surviving with winning—yet."

She talks—calm, precise—baiting impatience, pulling attention to noise and timing. When the opening appears, she moves fast: a short strike to disrupt balance, a shove into the wall, and a dash into the flow of passing cadets.\n\nShe doesn’t win the fight.\n\nBut she escapes it.\n\nLater, alone, she looks at her bruised hands and realizes something unsettling: Basgiath is teaching her a language she never wanted to speak.\n\nAnd somewhere beyond stone and steel, dragons are waiting—indifferent, dangerous, and impossibly alive."

Small, fragile, and living with chronic illness, Violet must survive brutal trials, deadly classmates and volatile dragons. As she bonds with unexpected allies—including a feared dragon and the enemy of her family—she’s pulled into a rebellion that questions everything she’s been taught."
