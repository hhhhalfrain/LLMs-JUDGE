She tries to argue with logic and precedent; her mother answers with authority and finality. Violet’s body protests before her mind finishes processing: old pain, weak joints, the familiar cost of simply standing too long. Around her, the war college feels like a machine built to grind down hesitation.\n\nShe packs quickly—practical items, notes, a few comforts—and runs through survival rules she’s heard whispered: trust slowly, watch the parapets, and never assume someone won’t push you.\n\nBy night, she studies maps and rumors. Riders are power and politics. Dragons are not pets. And in Basgiath, the line between training and execution is… not a line at all."

      "text": "Chapter 2 (Test Data)\nBasgiath’s stone towers loom like a verdict. Cadets gather in a tense crowd, pretending not to look afraid. Violet keeps to the edge, conserving energy, measuring exits, noticing who watches whom. Some recruits boast loudly—performance as armor. Others stay silent, their eyes fixed on the narrow walkways that bridge the heights.\n\nA senior cadet reads the rules with a smile that doesn’t reach their eyes: there will be tests, eliminations, and consequences. Violet hears the unspoken part: the college is not obligated to keep you alive.\n\nWhen the first trial is announced, the crowd shifts. Violet’s pulse spikes. She fights the reflex to freeze and instead breaks the problem into parts: footing, pace, breathing, and angles. Survive the first hour. Then the next."

    "intro": "Violet Sorrengail expects a quiet life as a scribe, but her ruthless general mother forces her into Basgiath War College, where dragon riders are trained and cadets die easily. Small, fragile, and living with chronic illness, Violet must survive brutal trials, deadly classmates and volatile dragons. As she bonds with unexpected allies—including a feared dragon and the enemy of her family—she’s pulled into a rebellion that questions everything she’s been taught."
